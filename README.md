# Genshin Emote Market

This repo contains code related that simulates a market where emotes are put on the market and users can buy emotes! There is a login system where users can register and sell their own items. The code is adapted from JimShapedCoding [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr4QMBUPxWo&t=8491s)!

This is one of my first projects with Flask, so improvements will be made!
